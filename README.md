# Seasonal-Sales

### Description:
> The purpose of this project is to practice XHRs (XML HTTP Requests). The program will read the Products.json and Categories.json files, parse them and then create Arrays that will list the products. There is a Select control that allows the user to select a Season and the corresponding products that have sales during that season will be automatically discounted. Prices all go back to normal when the "Select" option is selected.

### How to run:
```
http-server -p 8888
```

> This will show at:
`http://localhost:8888`
